What is LibQtScreen?

  LibQtScreen is a Qt 5 library for taking screenshots of fullscreen DirectX
  and OpenGL applications. It supports DirectX from 8 to 11, OpenGL, win32
  and win64 applications. It can be compiled with MSVC and MinGW gcc.
  
How does it works?

  LibQtScreen injects dll into fullscreen applications. Injected dll intercepts
  DirectX and OpenGL draw functions, copy rendered frame and returns it back.
  
How can I use it?

  * copy libqtscreen to your project
  * add include(libqtscreen/libqtscreen.pri) to your .pro file
  * use NQtScreen::TScreenShotMaker to make screenshot (see screener example)
  * you also need helper32.exe, helper64.exe, libqtscreen32.dll and libqtscreen64.dll.
    You can build it yourself (injected_dll) or take pre-built dlls (build directory).
	Put them near your applications executable.

Why do I need helper32.exe, helper64.exe, libqtscreen32.dll and libqtscreen64.dll?

  Dll is required to inject code into directx and opengl applications. You need one
  for 32bit and one for 64bit process. Helper64.exe is required to be able to inject
  64bit dll into 64bit process from your 32bit compiled program, and helper32.exe is
  required to inject 32bit dll into 32bit process from your 64bit compiled program.
