What is LibQtScreen?

  LibQtScreen is a qt library for taking screenshots of 
  fullscreen DirectX and OpenGL applications.
  
How does it works?

  LibQtScreen injects dll into fullscreen applications.
  Injected dll intercepts DirectX and OpenGL draw
  functions, copy rendered frame and returns it back.

How can I use it?

  * copy libqtscreen to your project
  * add include(libqtscreen/libqtscreen.pri) to your .pro file
  * use NQtScreen::TScreenShotMaker to make screenshot (see screener example)
  * you also need libqtscreen32.dll and libqtscreen64.dll.
    You can build it yourself (injected_dll) or take
	pre-built dlls (build directory). Put them near your
	applications executable.
